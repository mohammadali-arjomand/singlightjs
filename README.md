# How to use
First, write your Static-Elements (AppShell) and Dynamic-Element in `index.html`:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Test - Singlight</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Static-Element -->
    <header>Singlight</header>

    <!-- Dynamic-Element -->
    <div id="app"></div>

    <!-- Static-Element -->
    <footer>Copyright (Â©) 2023 Singlight</footer>
</body>
</html>
```
Now, create your `home.html` file:
```html
<h1>Welcome to first page</h1>
<a href="profile.html">My profile</a>
```
Create your `profile.html` file:
```html
<h1>My prfile</h1>
<a href="home.html">Come back</a>
```
> NOTICE in pages like `home.html` or `profile.html` you shouldn't write HTML template. only create your page

and Now, install Singlight and write this code in your scripts:
```js
const app = new Singlight({
    root: "example.com",
    home: "home.html"
});
app.mount("#app");
``` 
> NOTICE `home` property isn't your `index.html`. It's your first page loaded to dynamic-element like `home.html`
